Basically, you need to have environemnt with the following:
1. python 2.7
2. django 1.6.X
3. database: we use postgres, both locally and remotely. But I think you can handle it with the more standard sqlite3.
4. redis
5. git
6. pip installer  (python installer)
7. scipy + numpy - This is the most complex part, maybe on window this would be easier.
8. bunch of other python packages (installed via pip)

locally we wok on virtualenv, up to you (not sure how this works on windows).
